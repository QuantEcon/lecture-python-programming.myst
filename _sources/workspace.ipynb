    "# Writing Longer Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have explored the use of Jupyter Notebooks in writing and executing Python code. \n",
    "\n",
    "While they are efficient and adaptable when working with short pieces of code, Notebooks are not the best choice for longer programs and scripts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are well suited to interactive computing (i.e. data science workflows) and can help execute chunks of code one at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Text files and scripts allow for long pieces of code to be written and executed in a single go.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore the use of Python scripts as an alternative.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Lab and Visual Studio Code (VS Code) development environments are then introduced along with a primer on version control (Git).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, you will learn to\n",
    "- work with Python scripts\n",
    "- set up various development environments\n",
    "- get started with GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Going forward, it is assumed that you have an Anaconda environment up and running.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to [create a new conda environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands) if you haven't done so already.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with Python files \n",
    "\n",
    "Python files are used when writing long, reusable blocks of code - by convention, they have a `.py` suffix. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us begin by working with the following example.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} python\n",
    ":caption: sine_wave.py\n",
    ":lineno-start: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)\n",
    "y = np.sin(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "plt.plot(x, y)\n",
    "plt.xlabel('x')\n",
    "plt.ylabel('y')\n",
    "plt.title('Sine Wave')\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is first saved locally on the computer before it is executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "As there are various ways to execute the code, we will explore them in the context of different development environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "One major advantage of using Python scripts lies in the fact that you can \"import\" functionality from other scripts into your current script or Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's rewrite the earlier code into a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} python\n",
    ":caption: sine_wave.py\n",
    ":lineno-start: 1\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the plot_wave function.\n",
    "def plot_wave(title : str = 'Sine Wave'):\n",
    "  x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)\n",
    "  y = np.sin(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "  plt.plot(x, y)\n",
    "  plt.xlabel('x')\n",
    "  plt.ylabel('y')\n",
    "  plt.title(title)\n",
    "  plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} python\n",
    ":caption: second_script.py\n",
    ":lineno-start: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "import sine_wave # Import the sine_wave script\n",
    " \n",
    "# Call the plot_wave function.\n",
    "sine_wave.plot_wave(\"Sine Wave - Called from the Second Script\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to split your code into chunks and structure your codebase better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look into the use of [modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) and [packages](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages) for more information on importing functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Development environments\n",
    "\n",
    "A development environment is a one stop workspace where you can \n",
    "- edit and run your code\n",
    "- test and debug \n",
    "- manage project files\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture takes you through the workings of two development environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A step forward from Jupyter Notebooks: JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "JupyterLab is a browser based development environment for Jupyter Notebooks, code scripts, and data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can [try JupyterLab in the browser](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/) if you want to test it out before installing it locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install JupyterLab using pip\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> pip install jupyterlab\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "and launch it in the browser, similar to Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> jupyter-lab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "You can see that the Jupyter Server is running on port 8888 on the localhost. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following interface should open up on your default browser automatically - if not, CTRL + Click the server URL.\n",

    "\n",
    "- the Python 3 (ipykernel) button under Notebooks to open a new Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "- the Python File button to open a new Python script (.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can always open this launcher tab by clicking the '+' button on the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the files and folders in your working directory can be found in the File Browser (tab on the left).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create new files and folders using the buttons available at the top of the File Browser tab. \n",

    "- Using magic commands\n",
    "- Using the terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using magic commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks and JupyterLab support the use of [magic commands](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html) - commands that extend the capabilities of a standard Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `%run` magic command allows you to run a Python script from within a Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a convenient way to run scripts that you are working on in the same directory as your Notebook and present the outputs within the Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/workspace/jupyter_lab_py_run.png\n",
    ":figclass: auto\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you are looking into just running the `.py` file, it is sometimes easier to use the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a terminal from the launcher and run the following command.\n",

    "VS Code opens a new Terminal in the same directory you are working in - a PowerShell in Windows and a Bash in Linux.\n",
