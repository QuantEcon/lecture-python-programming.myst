    "seeking a different path to fast execution: parallelization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hardware makers have increased the number of cores (physical CPUs) embedded in each machine.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Types of Parallelization\n",
    "\n",
    "Large textbooks have been written on different approaches to parallelization but we will keep a tight focus on what's most useful to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will briefly review the two main kinds of parallelization commonly used in\n",
    "scientific computing and discuss their pros and cons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing means concurrent execution of multiple processes using more than one processor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, a **process** is a chain of instructions (i.e., a program).\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing can be carried out on one machine with multiple CPUs or on a\n",
    "collection of machines connected by a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the latter case, the collection of machines is usually called a\n",
    "**cluster**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With multiprocessing, each process has its own memory space, although the\n",
    "physical memory chip might be shared.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multithreading\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is similar to multiprocessing, except that, during execution, the threads all share the same memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Native Python struggles to implement multithreading due to some [legacy design\n",
    "features](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock).\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is not a restriction for scientific libraries like NumPy and Numba.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions imported from these libraries and JIT-compiled code run in low level\n",
    "execution environments where Python's legacy restrictions don't apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is more lightweight because most system and memory resources\n",
    "are shared by the threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the fact that multiple threads all access a shared pool of memory\n",
    "is extremely convenient for numerical programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, multiprocessing is more flexible and can be distributed\n",
    "across clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the great majority of what we do in these lectures, multithreading will\n",
    "suffice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implicit Multithreading in NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, you have already been using multithreading in your Python code,\n",
    "although you might not have realized it.\n",
    "\n",
    "(We are, as usual, assuming that you are running the latest version of\n",
    "Anaconda Python.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because NumPy cleverly implements multithreading in a lot of its\n",
    "compiled code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at some examples to see this in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Matrix Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "The next piece of code computes the eigenvalues of a large number of randomly\n",
    "generated matrices.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "But if this is true, then why isn't the Numba code faster?\n",

    "### A Warning\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelization works well in the outer loop of the last example because the individual tasks inside the loop are independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this independence fails then parallelization is often problematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, each step inside the inner loop depends on the last step, so\n",
    "independence fails, and this is why we use ordinary `range` instead of `prange`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you see us using `prange` in later lectures, it is because the\n",
    "independence of tasks holds true.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you see us using ordinary `range` in a jitted function, it is either because the speed gain from parallelization is small or because independence fails.\n",

    "### Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In {ref}`an earlier exercise <speed_ex1>`, we used Numba to accelerate an\n",
    "effort to compute the constant $\\pi$ by Monte Carlo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now try adding parallelization and see if you get further speed gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should not expect huge gains here because, while there are many\n",
    "independent tasks (draw point and test if in circle), each one has low\n",
    "execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, parallelization is less effective when the individual\n",
    "tasks to be parallelized are very small relative to total execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is due to overheads associated with spreading all of these small tasks across multiple CPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, with suitable hardware, it is possible to get nontrivial speed gains in this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the size of the Monte Carlo simulation, use something substantial, such as\n",
    "`n = 100_000_000`.\n",
