    "Hardware makers have increased the number of cores (physical CPUs) embedded in each machine.\n",

    "\n",
    "Large textbooks have been written on different approaches to parallelization but we will keep a tight focus on what's most useful to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will briefly review the two main kinds of parallelization commonly used in\n",
    "scientific computing and discuss their pros and cons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing means concurrent execution of multiple processes using more than one processor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, a **process** is a chain of instructions (i.e., a program).\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing can be carried out on one machine with multiple CPUs or on a\n",
    "collection of machines connected by a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the latter case, the collection of machines is usually called a\n",
    "**cluster**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With multiprocessing, each process has its own memory space, although the\n",
    "physical memory chip might be shared.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multithreading\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is similar to multiprocessing, except that, during execution, the threads all share the same memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Native Python struggles to implement multithreading due to some [legacy design\n",
    "features](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock).\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is not a restriction for scientific libraries like NumPy and Numba.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions imported from these libraries and JIT-compiled code run in low level\n",
    "execution environments where Python's legacy restrictions don't apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is more lightweight because most system and memory resources\n",
    "are shared by the threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the fact that multiple threads all access a shared pool of memory\n",
    "is extremely convenient for numerical programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, multiprocessing is more flexible and can be distributed\n",
    "across clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the great majority of what we do in these lectures, multithreading will\n",
    "suffice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implicit Multithreading in NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, you have already been using multithreading in your Python code,\n",
    "although you might not have realized it.\n",
    "\n",
    "(We are, as usual, assuming that you are running the latest version of\n",
    "Anaconda Python.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because NumPy cleverly implements multithreading in a lot of its\n",

    "\n",
    "Numba avoids creating all these intermediate arrays by compiling one\n",

    "\n",
    "But if this is true, then why isn't the Numba code faster?\n",

    "\n",
    "Parallelization works well in the outer loop of the last example because the individual tasks inside the loop are independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this independence fails then parallelization is often problematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, each step inside the inner loop depends on the last step, so\n",

    "independence of tasks holds true.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you see us using ordinary `range` in a jitted function, it is either because the speed gain from parallelization is small or because independence fails.\n",
