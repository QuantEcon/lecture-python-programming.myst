    "In this lecture we will\n",
    "\n",
    "* outline what Python is\n",
    "* compare it to some other languages\n",
    "* showcase some of its abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, it's **not** our intention that you try to replicate all you see.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will work through what follows at a slow pace later in the lecture series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our only objective for this lecture is to give you some feel of what Python is, and what it can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](https://www.python.org) is a general-purpose programming language conceived in 1989 by Dutch programmer [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is free and open source, with development coordinated through the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has experienced rapid adoption in the last decade and is now one of the [most popular programming languages](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Uses\n",
    "\n",
    "{index}`Python <single: Python; common uses>` is a general-purpose language used in almost all application domains such as\n",
    "\n",
    "* AI\n",
    "* communication\n",
    "* web development\n",
    "* CGI and graphical user interfaces\n",
    "* game development\n",
    "* resource planning\n",
    "* multimedia, data science, security, etc., etc., etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Used and supported extensively by Internet services and high-tech companies including\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Google](https://www.google.com/)\n",
    "* [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/)\n",
    "* [Meta](https://opensource.fb.com/)\n",
    "* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)\n",
    "* [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/)\n",
    "* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "For reasons we will discuss, Python is particularly popular within the scientific community \n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, Python is also very beginner-friendly and is found to be suitable for\n",
    "students learning programming and recommended to introduce computational methods\n",
    "to students in fields other than computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is also replacing familiar tools like Excel as an essential skill in the fields of finance and banking.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relative Popularity\n",
    "\n",
    "The following chart, produced using Stack Overflow Trends, shows one measure of the relative popularity of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/about_py/python_vs_matlab.png\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure indicates not only that Python is widely used but also that adoption of Python has accelerated significantly since 2012.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is driven at least in part by uptake in the scientific domain, particularly in rapidly growing fields like data science and AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a [high-level language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language) suitable for rapid development.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has a relatively small core language supported by many libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other features of Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* multiple programming styles are supported (procedural, object-oriented, functional, etc.)\n",
    "* it is interpreted rather than compiled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax and Design\n",
    "\n",
    "```{index} single: Python; syntax and design\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One nice feature of Python is its elegant syntax --- we'll see many examples later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elegant code might sound superfluous but in fact it's highly beneficial because it makes the syntax easy to read and easy to remember.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closely related to elegant syntax is an elegant design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features like iterators, generators, decorators and list comprehensions make Python highly expressive, allowing you to get more done with less code.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace) improve productivity by cutting down on bugs and syntax errors.\n",

    "* astronomy\n",
