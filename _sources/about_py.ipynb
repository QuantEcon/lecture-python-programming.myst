    "\"Python has gotten sufficiently weapons grade that we donâ€™t descend into R\n",
    "anymore. Sorry, R people. I used to be one of you but we no longer descend\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture series will teach you to use Python for scientific computing, with\n",
    "a focus on economics and finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The series is aimed at Python novices, although experienced users will also find\n",
    "useful content in later lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will\n",
    "\n",
    "* introduce Python,\n",
    "* showcase some of its abilities,\n",
    "* explain why Python is our favorite language for scientific computing, and\n",
    "* point you to the next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do **not** need to understand everything you see in this lecture -- we will work through the details slowly later in the lecture series.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Can't I Just Use LLMs?\n",
    "\n",
    "No!\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course it's tempting to think that in the age of AI we don't need to learn how to code.\n",
    "\n",
    "And yes, we like to be lazy too sometimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we agree that AIs are outstanding productivity tools for coders.\n",
    "\n",
    "But AIs cannot reliably solve new problems that they haven't seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to be the architect and the supervisor -- and for these tasks you need to\n",
    "be able to read, write, and understand computer code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having said that, a good LLM is a useful companion for these lectures -- try copy-pasting some\n",
    "code from this series and asking for an explanation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Isn't MATLAB Better?\n",
    "\n",
    "No, no, and one hundred times no.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nirvana was great (and Soundgarden [was better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mbBbFH9fAg&list=RD3mbBbFH9fAg)) but\n",
    "it's time to move on from the '90s.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most modern problems, Python's scientific libraries are now far in advance of MATLAB's capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is particularly the case in fast-growing fields such as deep learning and reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, all major LLMs are more proficient at writing Python code than MATLAB\n",
    "code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss relative merits of Python's libraries throughout this lecture\n",
    "series, as well as in our later series on [JAX](https://jax.quantecon.org/intro.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introducing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](https://www.python.org) is a general-purpose programming language conceived in 1989 by [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is free and [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), with development coordinated through the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is important because it\n",
    "\n",
    "* saves us money,\n",
    "* means that Python is controlled by the community of users rather than a for-profit corporation, and\n",
    "* encourages reproducibility and [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Uses\n",
    "\n",
    "{index}`Python <single: Python; common uses>` is a general-purpose language used\n",
    "in almost all application domains, including\n",
    "\n",
    "* AI and computer science\n",
    "* other scientific computing\n",
    "* communication\n",
    "* web development\n",
    "* CGI and graphical user interfaces\n",
    "* game development\n",
    "* resource planning\n",
    "* multimedia\n",
    "* etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used and supported extensively by large tech firms including\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Google](https://www.google.com/)\n",
    "* [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)\n",
    "* [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/)\n",
    "* [Meta](https://opensource.fb.com/)\n",
    "* [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/)\n",
    "* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)\n",
    "* etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relative Popularity\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is one of the most -- if not the most -- [popular programming languages](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python libraries like [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Polars](https://pola.rs/) are replacing familiar tools like Excel and VBA as an essential skill in the fields of finance and banking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, Python is extremely popular within the scientific community -- especially those connected to AI\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following chart from Stack Overflow Trends shows how the\n",
    "popularity of a single Python deep learning library\n",
    "([PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)) has grown over the last few years.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/about_py/pytorch_vs_matlab.png\n",
    "```\n",
    "Pytorch is just one of several Python libraries for deep learning and AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a [high-level\n",
    "language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language), which\n",
    "means it is relatively easy to read, write and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has a relatively small core language that is easy to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "This core is supported by many libraries, which can be studied as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is flexible and pragmatic, supporting multiple programming styles (procedural, object-oriented, functional, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax and Design\n",
    "\n",
    "```{index} single: Python; syntax and design\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason for Python's popularity is its simple and elegant design.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a feeling for this, let's look at an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below is written in [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) rather than Python.\n",
