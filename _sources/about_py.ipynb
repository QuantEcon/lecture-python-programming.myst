    "We will work through what follows at a slow pace later in the lecture series.\n",

    "Our only objective for this lecture is to give you some feel of what Python is, and what it can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](https://www.python.org) is a general-purpose programming language conceived in 1989 by Dutch programmer [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is free and open source, with development coordinated through the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has experienced rapid adoption in the last decade and is now one of the [most popular programming languages](https://pythoncircle.com/post/763/the-rising-popularity-of-python/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Uses\n",
    "\n",
    "{index}`Python <single: Python; common uses>` is a general-purpose language used in almost all application domains such as\n",
    "\n",
    "* communications\n",
    "* web development\n",
    "* CGI and graphical user interfaces\n",
    "* game development\n",
    "* resource planning\n",
    "* multimedia, data science, security, etc., etc., etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Used and supported extensively by Internet services and high-tech companies including\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Google](https://www.google.com/)\n",
    "* [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/)\n",
    "* [Meta](https://opensource.fb.com/)\n",
    "* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)\n",
    "* [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/)\n",
    "* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "For reasons we will discuss, Python is particularly popular within the scientific community and behind many scientific achievements in \n",
    "* [Space Science](https://code.nasa.gov/?q=python)\n",
    "* [Particle Physics](https://home.cern/news/news/physics/speeding-machine-learning-particle-physics)\n",
    "* [Genetics](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold)\n",
    "\n",
    "and practically all branches of academia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, Python is also very beginner-friendly and is found to be suitable for students learning programming and recommended to introduce computational methods to students in [fields other than computer science](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477388021000177).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is also [replacing familiar tools like Excel as an essential skill](https://www.efinancialcareers.com.au/news/2021/08/python-for-banking-jobs) in the fields of finance and banking.\n",

    "### Relative Popularity\n",

    "The following chart, produced using Stack Overflow Trends, shows one measure of the relative popularity of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/about_py/python_vs_matlab.png\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure indicates not only that Python is widely used but also that adoption of Python has accelerated significantly since 2012.\n",
    "\n",
    "We suspect this is driven at least in part by uptake in the scientific\n",
    "domain, particularly in rapidly growing fields like data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the popularity of [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), a library for data analysis with Python has exploded, as seen here.\n",
    "\n",
    "(The corresponding time path for MATLAB is shown for comparison)\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/about_py/pandas_vs_matlab.png\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that pandas takes off in 2012, which is the same year that we see\n",
    "Python's popularity begin to spike in the first figure.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Python is [one of the most popular programming languages worldwide](https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2021).\n",
    "* Python is a major tool for scientific computing, accounting for a rapidly rising share of scientific work around the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a [high-level language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language) suitable for rapid development.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has a relatively small core language supported by many libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other features of Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* multiple programming styles are supported (procedural, object-oriented, functional, etc.)\n",
    "* it is interpreted rather than compiled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax and Design\n",
    "\n",
    "```{index} single: Python; syntax and design\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One nice feature of Python is its elegant syntax --- we'll see many examples later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elegant code might sound superfluous but in fact it's highly beneficial because it makes the syntax easy to read and easy to remember.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remembering how to read from files, sort dictionaries and other such routine tasks means that you don't need to break your flow in order to hunt down correct syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closely related to elegant syntax is an elegant design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features like iterators, generators, decorators and list comprehensions make Python highly expressive, allowing you to get more done with less code.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace) improve productivity by cutting down on bugs and syntax errors.\n",
