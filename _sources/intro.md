# Python Programming for Economics and Finance

This website presents a set of lectures on Python programming for economics and finance, designed and written by
[Thomas J. Sargent](http://www.tomsargent.com/) and [John Stachurski](http://johnstachurski.net/). This is the first text in the series, which focuses on programming in Python.

```{admonition} New Build System
[QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org) is moving to the [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html)
build system for all of its projects. We are a founding member of the
[Executable Books Project](https://github.com/executablebooks), an international collaboration to
build open source tools that facilitate publishing using the Jupyter
ecosystem. Please send feedback to [contact@quantecon.org](mailto:contact@quantecon.org)
```

```{admonition} News
Tom Sargent, Chase Coleman, and Spencer Lyon have put together The [NYU Computational Social
Science: Certificate Program](http://www.tomsargent.com/nyu_css.html).
It uses many [quantecon](https://quantecon.org/lectures/index.html)
resources. The program  aims to prepare students for either a graduate program in the social
sciences or for a career as a data analyst or computational social scientist.

[Applications and additional information are available here](https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/departments/computational-social-science.html)
