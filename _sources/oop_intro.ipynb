    "# OOP I: Objects and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The traditional programming paradigm (think Fortran, C, MATLAB, etc.) is called [procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming).\n",
    "\n",
    "It works as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "* The program has a state corresponding to the values of its variables.\n",
    "* Functions are called to act on and transform the state.\n",
    "* Final outputs are produced via a sequence of function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two other important paradigms are [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) (OOP) and [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the OOP paradigm, data and functions are bundled together into \"objects\" --- and functions in this context are referred to as **methods**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are called on to transform the data contained in the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Think of a Python list that contains data and has methods such as `append()` and `pop()` that transform the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming languages are built on the idea of composing functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Influential examples include [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp), [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell) and [Elixir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir_(programming_language)).\n",
    "\n",
    "So which of these categories does Python fit into?\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually Python is a pragmatic language that blends object-oriented, functional and procedural styles, rather than taking a purist approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "On one hand, this allows Python and its users to cherry pick nice aspects of different paradigms.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the lack of purity might at times lead to some confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately this confusion is minimized if you understand that, at a foundational level, Python *is* object-oriented.\n",
    "\n",
    "By this we mean that, in Python, *everything is an object*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we explain what that statement means and why it matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll make use of the following third party library"
