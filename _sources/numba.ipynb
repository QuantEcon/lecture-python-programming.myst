    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In an {doc}`earlier lecture <need_for_speed>` we learned about vectorization, which is one method to improve speed and efficiency in numerical work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectorization involves sending array processing\n",
    "operations in batch to efficient low-level code.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as {ref}`discussed previously <numba-p_c_vectorization>`, vectorization has several weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "One is that it is highly memory-intensive when working with large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another is that the set of algorithms that can be entirely vectorized is not universal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, for some algorithms, vectorization is ineffective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, a new Python library called [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/)\n",
    "solves many of these problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does so through something called **just in time (JIT) compilation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is to compile functions to native machine code instructions on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it succeeds, the compiled code is extremely fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba is specifically designed for numerical work and can also do other tricks such as [multithreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading_%28computer_architecture%29).\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba will be a key part of our lectures --- especially those lectures involving dynamic programming.\n",

    "\n",
    "Numba attempts to generate fast machine code using the infrastructure provided by the [LLVM Project](http://llvm.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "It does this by inferring type information on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "(See our {doc}`earlier lecture <need_for_speed>` on scientific computing for a discussion of types.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python is very flexible and hence we could call the function qm with many\n",
    "  types.\n",
    "    * e.g., `x0` could be a NumPy array or a list, `n` could be an integer or a float, etc.\n",
    "* This makes it hard to *pre*-compile the function (i.e., compile before runtime).\n",
    "* However, when we do actually call the function, say by running `qm(0.5, 10)`,\n",
    "  the types of `x0` and `n` become clear.\n",
    "* Moreover, the types of other variables in `qm` can be inferred once the input types are known.\n",
    "* So the strategy of Numba and other JIT compilers is to wait until this\n",
    "  moment, and *then* compile the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why it is called \"just-in-time\" compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, if you make the call `qm(0.5, 10)` and then follow it with `qm(0.9, 20)`, compilation only takes place on the first call.\n",
    "\n",
    "The compiled code is then cached and recycled as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why, in the code above, `time3` is smaller than `time2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decorator Notation\n",

    "There are additional options for accelerating Python loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we quickly review them.\n",

    "### Cython\n",
    "\n",
    "Like {doc}`Numba <numba>`,  [Cython](http://cython.org/) provides an approach to generating fast compiled code that can be used from Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "As was the case with Numba, a key problem is the fact that Python is dynamically typed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you'll recall, Numba solves this problem (where possible) by inferring type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cython's approach is different --- programmers add type definitions directly to their \"Python\" code.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, the Cython language can be thought of as Python with type definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to a language specification, Cython is also a language translator, transforming Cython code into optimized C and C++ code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cython also takes care of building language extensions --- the wrapper code that interfaces between the resulting compiled code and Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Cython has certain advantages, we generally find it both slower and more\n",
    "cumbersome than Numba.\n",

    "If you are comfortable writing Fortran you will find it very easy to create\n",
    "extension modules from Fortran code using [F2Py](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/f2py/).\n",

    "\n",

    "## Summary and Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review the above and add some cautionary notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've seen, Numba needs to infer type information on\n",
    "all variables to generate fast machine-level instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simple routines, Numba infers types very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For larger ones, or for routines using external libraries, it can easily fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, it's prudent when using Numba to focus on speeding up small, time-critical snippets of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will give you much better performance than blanketing your Python programs with `@njit` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Gotcha: Global Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's another thing to be careful about when using Numba.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following example"
