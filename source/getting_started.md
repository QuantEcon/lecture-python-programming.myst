# Setting up Your Python Environment

```{index}
single: Python

```

## Overview

In this lecture, you will learn how to

1. get a Python environment up and running
1. execute simple Python commands
1. run a sample program
1. install the code libraries that underpin these lectures

## Anaconda

The [core Python package](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is easy to install but *not* what you should choose for these lectures.

These lectures require the entire scientific programming ecosystem, which

* the core installation doesn't provide
* is painful to install one piece at a time.

Hence the best approach for our purposes is to install a Python distribution that contains

1. the core Python language **and**
1. compatible versions of the most popular scientific libraries.

The best such distribution is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/).

Anaconda is

* very popular
* cross-platform
* comprehensive
* completely unrelated to the Nicki Minaj song of the same name

Anaconda also comes with a great package management system to organize your code libraries.

**All of what follows assumes that you adopt this recommendation!**

(install_anaconda)=
### Installing Anaconda

```{index}
single: Python; Anaconda
```

To install Anaconda, [download](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) the binary and follow the instructions.

Important points:

* Install the latest version!
* If you are asked during the installation process whether you'd like to make Anaconda your default Python installation, say yes.

### Updating Anaconda

Anaconda supplies a tool called conda to manage and upgrade your Anaconda packages.

One conda command you should execute regularly is the one that updates the whole Anaconda distribution.

As a practice run, please execute the following

1. Open up a terminal
1. Type `conda update anaconda`

For more information on conda,  type conda help in a terminal.

(ipython_notebook)=
## Jupyter Notebooks

```{index}
single: Python; IPython
```

```{index}
single: IPython
```

```{index}
single: Jupyter
```

[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks are one of the many possible ways to interact with Python and the scientific libraries.

They use  a *browser-based* interface to Python with

* The ability to write and execute Python commands.
* Formatted output in the browser, including tables, figures, animation, etc.
* The option to mix in formatted text and mathematical expressions.

Because of these features, Jupyter is now a major player in the scientific computing ecosystem.

Here's an image showing execution of some code (borrowed from [here](http://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/hexbin_demo.html)) in a Jupyter notebook

```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/jp_demo.png
:scale: 45
```

While Jupyter isn't the only way to code in Python, it's great for when you wish to

* start coding in Python
* test new ideas or interact with small pieces of code
* share or collaborate scientific ideas with students or colleagues

These lectures are designed for executing in Jupyter notebooks.

### Starting the Jupyter Notebook

```{index}
single: Jupyter Notebook; Setup
```

Once you have installed Anaconda, you can start the Jupyter notebook.

Either

* search for Jupyter in your applications menu, or
* open up a terminal and type `jupyter notebook`
    * Windows users should substitute "Anaconda command prompt" for "terminal" in the previous line.

If you use the second option, you will see something like this

```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/starting_nb.png
:scale: 45
```

The output tells us the notebook is running at `http://localhost:8888/`

* `localhost` is the name of the local machine
* `8888` refers to [port number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_%28computer_networking%29) 8888 on your computer

Thus, the Jupyter kernel is listening for Python commands on port 8888 of our local machine.

Hopefully, your default browser has also opened up with a web page that looks something like this

```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/nb.png
:scale: 45
```

What you see here is called the Jupyter *dashboard*.

If you look at the URL at the top, it should be `localhost:8888` or similar, matching the message above.

Assuming all this has worked OK, you can now click on `New` at the top right and select `Python 3` or similar.

Here's what shows up on our machine:

```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/nb2.png
:scale: 45
```

The notebook displays an *active cell*, into which you can type Python commands.

### Notebook Basics

```{index}
single: Jupyter Notebook; Basics
```

Let's start with how to edit code and run simple programs.

#### Running Cells

Notice that, in the previous figure, the cell is surrounded by a green border.

This means that the cell is in *edit mode*.

In this mode, whatever you type will appear in the cell with the flashing cursor.

When you're ready to execute the code in a cell, hit `Shift-Enter` instead of the usual `Enter`.

```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/nb3.png
:scale: 45
```

(Note: There are also menu and button options for running code in a cell that you can find by exploring)

#### Modal Editing

The next thing to understand about the Jupyter notebook is that it uses a *modal* editing system.

This means that the effect of typing at the keyboard **depends on which mode you are in**.

The two modes are

1. Edit mode
    * Indicated by a green border around one cell, plus a blinking cursor
    * Whatever you type appears as is in that cell
1. Command mode
    * The green border is replaced by a grey (or grey and blue) border
    * Keystrokes are interpreted as commands --- for example, typing b adds a new cell below  the current one

To switch to

* command mode from edit mode, hit the `Esc` key or `Ctrl-M`
* edit mode from command mode, hit `Enter` or click in a cell

The modal behavior of the Jupyter notebook is very efficient when you get used to it.

#### Inserting Unicode (e.g., Greek Letters)

Python supports [unicode](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html), allowing the use of characters such as $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as names in your code.

In a code cell, try typing `\alpha` and then hitting the tab key on your keyboard.

(a_test_program)=
#### A Test Program

Let's run a test program.

Here's an arbitrary program we can use: [http://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/pie_and_polar_charts/polar_bar.html](http://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/pie_and_polar_charts/polar_bar.html).

On that page, you'll see the following code

```{code-cell} ipython
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

# Fixing random state for reproducibility
np.random.seed(19680801)

# Compute pie slices
N = 20
θ = np.linspace(0.0, 2 * np.pi, N, endpoint=False)
radii = 10 * np.random.rand(N)
width = np.pi / 4 * np.random.rand(N)
colors = plt.cm.viridis(radii / 10.)

ax = plt.subplot(111, projection='polar')
ax.bar(θ, radii, width=width, bottom=0.0, color=colors, alpha=0.5)

plt.show()
```

Don't worry about the details for now --- let's just run it and see what happens.

The easiest way to run this code is to copy and paste it into a cell in the notebook.

Hopefully you will get a similar plot.

### Working with the Notebook

Here are a few more tips on working with Jupyter notebooks.

#### Tab Completion

In the previous program, we executed the line `import numpy as np`

* NumPy is a numerical library we'll work with in depth.

After this import command, functions in NumPy can be accessed with `np.function_name` type syntax.

* For example, try `np.random.randn(3)`.

We can explore these attributes of `np` using the `Tab` key.

For example, here we type `np.ran` and hit Tab

```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/nb6.png
:scale: 45
```

Jupyter offers up the two possible completions, `random` and `rank`.

In this way, the Tab key helps remind you of what's available and also saves you typing.

(gs_help)=
#### On-Line Help

```{index}
single: Jupyter Notebook; Help
```

To get help on `np.rank`, say, we can execute `np.rank?`.

Documentation appears in a split window of the browser, like so

```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/nb6a.png
:scale: 45
```

Clicking on the top right of the lower split closes the on-line help.

#### Other Content

In addition to executing code, the Jupyter notebook allows you to embed text, equations, figures and even videos in the page.

For example, here we enter a mixture of plain text and LaTeX instead of code

```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/nb7.png
:scale: 45
```

Next we `Esc` to enter command mode and then type `m` to indicate that we
are writing [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), a mark-up language similar to (but simpler than) LaTeX.

(You can also use your mouse to select `Markdown` from the `Code` drop-down box just below the list of menu items)

Now we `Shift+Enter` to produce this

```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/nb8.png
:scale: 45
```

### Sharing Notebooks

```{index}
single: Jupyter Notebook; Sharing
```

```{index}
single: Jupyter Notebook; nbviewer
```

Notebook files are just text files structured in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) and typically ending with `.ipynb`.

You can share them in the usual way that you share files --- or by using web services such as [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

The notebooks you see on that site are **static** html representations.

To run one, download it as an `ipynb` file by clicking on the download icon at the top right.

Save it somewhere, navigate to it from the Jupyter dashboard and then run as discussed above.

### QuantEcon Notes

QuantEcon has its own site for sharing Jupyter notebooks related
to economics -- [QuantEcon Notes](http://notes.quantecon.org/).

Notebooks submitted to QuantEcon Notes can be shared with a link, and are open
to comments and votes by the community.

## Installing Libraries

(gs_qe)=
```{index}
single: QuantEcon
```

Most of the libraries we need come in Anaconda.

Other libraries can be installed with `pip` or `conda`.

One library we'll be using is [QuantEcon.py](http://quantecon.org/quantecon-py).

(gs_install_qe)=
You can install [QuantEcon.py](http://quantecon.org/quantecon-py) by
starting Jupyter and typing

```{code-block} ipython3
!conda install quantecon
```

into a cell.

Alternatively, you can type the following into a terminal

```{code-block} bash
conda install quantecon
```

More instructions can be found on the [library page](http://quantecon.org/quantecon-py).

To upgrade to the latest version, which you should do regularly, use

```{code-block} bash
conda upgrade quantecon
```

Another library we will be using is [interpolation.py](https://github.com/EconForge/interpolation.py).

This can be installed by typing in Jupyter

```{code-block} ipython3
!conda install -c conda-forge interpolation
```

## Working with Python Files

So far we've focused on executing Python code entered into a Jupyter notebook
cell.

Traditionally most Python code has been run in a different way.

Code is first saved in a text file on a local machine

By convention, these text files have a `.py` extension.

We can create an example of such a file as follows:

```{code-cell} ipython
%%file foo.py

print("foobar")
```

This writes the line `print("foobar")` into a file called `foo.py` in the local directory.

Here `%%file` is an example of a [cell magic](http://ipython.readthedocs.org/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#cell-magics).

### Editing and Execution

If you come across code saved in a `*.py` file, you'll need to consider the
following questions:

1. how should you execute it?
1. How should you modify or edit it?

#### Option 1: JupyterLab

```{index}
single: JupyterLab
```

[JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) is an integrated development environment built on top of Jupyter notebooks.

With JupyterLab you can edit and run `*.py` files as well as Jupyter notebooks.

To start JupyterLab, search for it in the applications menu or type `jupyter-lab` in a terminal.

Now you should be able to open, edit and run the file `foo.py` created above by opening it in JupyterLab.

Read the docs or search for a recent YouTube video to find more information.

#### Option 2: Using a Text Editor

One can also edit files using a text editor and then run them from within
Jupyter notebooks.

A text editor is an application that is specifically designed to work with text files --- such as Python programs.

Nothing beats the power and efficiency of a good text editor for working with program text.

A good text editor will provide

* efficient text editing commands (e.g., copy, paste, search and replace)
* syntax highlighting, etc.

Right now, an extremely popular text editor for coding is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

VS Code is easy to use out of the box and has many high quality extensions.

Alternatively, if you want an outstanding free text editor and don't mind a seemingly vertical learning curve plus long days of pain and suffering while all your neural pathways are rewired, try [Vim](http://www.vim.org/).

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

If Jupyter is still running, quit by using `Ctrl-C` at the terminal where
you started it.

Now launch again, but this time using `jupyter notebook --no-browser`.

This should start the kernel without launching the browser.

Note also the startup message: It should give you a URL such as `http://localhost:8888` where the notebook is running.

Now

1. Start your browser --- or open a new tab if it's already running.
1. Enter the URL from above (e.g. `http://localhost:8888`) in the address bar at the top.

You should now be able to run a standard Jupyter notebook session.

This is an alternative way to start the notebook that can also be handy.

### Exercise 2

```{index}
single: Git
```

This exercise will familiarize you with git and GitHub.

[Git](http://git-scm.com/) is a *version control system* --- a piece of software used to manage digital projects such as code libraries.

In many cases, the associated collections of files --- called *repositories* --- are stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

GitHub is a wonderland of collaborative coding projects.

For example, it hosts many of the scientific libraries we'll be using later
on, such as [this one](https://github.com/pydata/pandas).

Git is the underlying software used to manage these projects.

Git is an extremely powerful tool for distributed collaboration --- for
example, we use it to share and synchronize all the source files for these
lectures.

There are two main flavors of Git

1. the plain vanilla [command line Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) version
1. the various point-and-click GUI versions
    * See, for example, the [GitHub version](https://desktop.github.com/)

As the 1st task, try

1. Installing Git.
1. Getting a copy of [QuantEcon.py](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py) using Git.

For example, if you've installed the command line version, open up a terminal and enter.

> `git clone https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py`> .

(This is just `git clone` in front of the URL for the repository)

As the 2nd task,

1. Sign up to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
1. Look into 'forking' GitHub repositories (forking means making your own copy of a GitHub repository, stored on GitHub).
1. Fork [QuantEcon.py](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py).
1. Clone your fork to some local directory, make edits, commit them, and push them back up to your forked GitHub repo.
1. If you made a valuable improvement, send us a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)!

For reading on these and other topics, try

* [The official Git documentation](http://git-scm.com/doc).
* Reading through the docs on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
* [Pro Git Book](http://git-scm.com/book) by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub.
* One of the thousands of Git tutorials on the Net.
