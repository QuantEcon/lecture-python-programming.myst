# OOP I: Introduction to Object Oriented Programming

```{contents} Contents
:depth: 2
```

## Overview

[OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) is one of the major paradigms in programming.

The traditional programming paradigm (think Fortran, C, MATLAB, etc.) is called *procedural*.

It works as follows

* The program has a state corresponding to the values of its variables.
* Functions are called to act on these data.
* Data are passed back and forth via function calls.

In contrast, in the OOP paradigm

* data and functions are "bundled together" into "objects"

(Functions in this context are referred to as **methods**)

### Python and OOP

Python is a pragmatic language that blends object-oriented and procedural styles, rather than taking a purist approach.

However, at a foundational level, Python *is* object-oriented.

In particular, in Python, *everything is an object*.

In this lecture, we explain what that statement means and why it matters.

## Objects

```{index} single: Python; Objects
```

In Python, an *object* is a collection of data and instructions held in computer memory that consists of

1. a type
1. a unique identity
1. data (i.e., content)
1. methods

These concepts are defined and discussed sequentially below.

(type)=
### Type

```{index} single: Python; Type
```

Python provides for different types of objects, to accommodate different categories of data.

For example

```{code-cell} python3
s = 'This is a string'
type(s)
```

```{code-cell} python3
x = 42   # Now let's create an integer
type(x)
```

The type of an object matters for many expressions.

For example, the addition operator between two strings means concatenation

```{code-cell} python3
'300' + 'cc'
```

On the other hand, between two numbers it means ordinary addition

```{code-cell} python3
300 + 400
```

Consider the following expression

```{code-cell} python3
---
tags: [raises-exception]
---
'300' + 400
```

Here we are mixing types, and it's unclear to Python whether the user wants to

* convert `'300'` to an integer and then add it to `400`, or
* convert `400` to string and then concatenate it with `'300'`

Some languages might try to guess but Python is *strongly typed*

* Type is important, and implicit type conversion is rare.
* Python will respond instead by raising a `TypeError`.

To avoid the error, you need to clarify by changing the relevant type.

For example,

```{code-cell} python3
int('300') + 400   # To add as numbers, change the string to an integer
```

(identity)=
### Identity

```{index} single: Python; Identity
```

In Python, each object has a unique identifier, which helps Python (and us) keep track of the object.

The identity of an object can be obtained via the `id()` function

```{code-cell} python3
y = 2.5
z = 2.5
id(y)
```

```{code-cell} python3
id(z)
```

In this example, `y` and `z` happen to have the same value (i.e., `2.5`), but they are not the same object.

The identity of an object is in fact just the address of the object in memory.

### Object Content: Data and Attributes

```{index} single: Python; Content
```

If we set `x = 42` then we create an object of type `int` that contains
the data `42`.

In fact, it contains more, as the following example shows

```{code-cell} python3
x = 42
x
```

```{code-cell} python3
x.imag
```

```{code-cell} python3
x.__class__
```

When Python creates this integer object, it stores with it various auxiliary information, such as the imaginary part, and the type.

Any name following a dot is called an *attribute* of the object to the left of the dot.

* e.g.,``imag`` and `__class__` are attributes of `x`.

We see from this example that objects have attributes that contain auxiliary information.

They also have attributes that act like functions, called *methods*.

These attributes are important, so let's discuss them in-depth.

(methods)=
### Methods

```{index} single: Python; Methods
```

Methods are *functions that are bundled with objects*.

Formally, methods are attributes of objects that are callable (i.e., can be called as functions)

```{code-cell} python3
x = ['foo', 'bar']
callable(x.append)
```

```{code-cell} python3
callable(x.__doc__)
```

Methods typically act on the data contained in the object they belong to, or combine that data with other data

```{code-cell} python3
x = ['a', 'b']
x.append('c')
s = 'This is a string'
s.upper()
```

```{code-cell} python3
s.lower()
```

```{code-cell} python3
s.replace('This', 'That')
```

A great deal of Python functionality is organized around method calls.

For example, consider the following piece of code

```{code-cell} python3
x = ['a', 'b']
x[0] = 'aa'  # Item assignment using square bracket notation
x
```

It doesn't look like there are any methods used here, but in fact the square bracket assignment notation is just a convenient interface to a method call.

What actually happens is that Python calls the `__setitem__` method, as follows

```{code-cell} python3
x = ['a', 'b']
x.__setitem__(0, 'aa')  # Equivalent to x[0] = 'aa'
x
```

(If you wanted to you could modify the `__setitem__` method, so that square bracket assignment does something totally different)

## Summary

In Python, *everything in memory is treated as an object*.

This includes not just lists, strings, etc., but also less obvious things, such as

* functions (once they have been read into memory)
* modules  (ditto)
* files opened for reading or writing
* integers, etc.

Consider, for example, functions.

When Python reads a function definition, it creates a **function object** and stores it in memory.

The following code illustrates

```{code-cell} python3
def f(x): return x**2
f
```

```{code-cell} python3
type(f)
```

```{code-cell} python3
id(f)
```

```{code-cell} python3
f.__name__
```

We can see that `f` has type, identity, attributes and so on---just like any other object.

It also has methods.

One example is the `__call__` method, which just evaluates the function

```{code-cell} python3
f.__call__(3)
```

Another is the `__dir__` method, which returns a list of attributes.

Modules loaded into memory are also treated as objects

```{code-cell} python3
import math

id(math)
```

This uniform treatment of data in Python (everything is an object) helps keep the language simple and consistent.
